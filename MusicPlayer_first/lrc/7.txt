I stay up all night
Tell myself I'm alright
Baby you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on
Wait 'til I hear our song
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Never got the chance
To say your last goodbye
I gotta move on
But it hurts to try
How do I love how do I love again
How do I trust how do I trust again
I stay up all night
Tell myself I'm alright
Baby you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on
Wait 'til I hear our song
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
How do I love how do I love again
How do I trust how do I trust again
I stay up all night
Tell myself I'm alright
Baby you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on
Wait 'til I hear our song
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
